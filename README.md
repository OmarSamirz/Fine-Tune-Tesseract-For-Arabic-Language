## Introduction
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential for digital processing and preservation of textual information. Despite advancements in OCR for various languages, Arabic OCR remains challenging due to its complex script. This project aims to fine-tune an Arabic OCR system using **Tesseract 5.0**, achieving high accuracy in text recognition.
